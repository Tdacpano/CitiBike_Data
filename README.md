# Overview of the Citi Bike statistical analysis:
  The purpose of this analysis was to use bike-sharing data, from the Citi Bike System Data, in order to explore a potential bike-share program in Des Moines. This analysis was conducted using Tableau worksheets, dashboards and stories to help portray the data to potential investors. 

# Results:
  The analysis began by creating simple worksheets to answer potential questions an investor may have. The first being how many trips were recorded in the month of August?

  As the image shows we used the generated field that counts the number of records in the CSV file and added that to our text box to portray the amount of trips that were recorded in the month of August. We continued by showing the breakdown of individuals by gender of who uses these bikes most often.

  As the results show there was a count of 1,530,272 for males, 588,432 for females and 225,521 for unknown. These results give us an idea of which genders decide to use these bikes more often. 
  
  The analysis began to dig deeper by trying to solve the following questions: How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders? How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders? Lastly, a breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

  The images above show a visualization of the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender. It is obvious that the majority of bikes checked out do not last long then one hour. The peak of bikes rented last between 0 to 20 minutes. Additionally, males tend to rent bikes out longer then females but they both do not tend to rent them for more than one hour. 
  
  The next three images all conist of heatmaps to show the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day, show the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week, and finally to show the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype.

  The first images shows that the majority trips occurred betweenn Monday through Friday, 7 AM to 9 AM and then back up 4 PM to 7 PM. The weekends sees a consistent amount of trips between 10 AM to 6 PM on Saturdays and Sundays. 
  The second image provides greater insight then the first because it is broken up by gender. Males tend to use the bikes more often Females but both tend to use them around the same hours of the day. Males also clearly use the bikes on the weekends more as well. 
  Lastly, the third images shows a breakdown bewteen gender and whether an individual is subscribed or a one time customer. This images provides great insight to show that the majority of riders for both males and females come as subscribers compared to customers. Male subscribers tend to use the bikes the majority of the time while Females also use the bikes often just not as much. 

# Summary:
  In summary the bike-sharing opportunity for Des Moines looks promising. The best chance for succes would be to generate as many subscribers as possible to ensure that the bikes would be used as much as possible. It would also be a smart idea to try and gain more subscribers through the customers that tend to use the bikes more on weekends then weekdays. It appears the majority or riders will tend to be Males compared to Females as well.
