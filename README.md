# CitiBike_Data
Using Bike-Sharing data through Tableau 

# Overview of the statistical analysis:
  The purpose of this analysis was to use bike-sharing data, from the Citi Bike System Data, in order to explore a potential bike-share program in Des Moines. This analysis was conducted using Tableau worksheets, dashboards and stories to help portray the data to potential investors. 

#Results:
  The analysis began by creating simple worksheets to answer potential questions an investor may have. The first being how many trips were recorded in the month of August?

  As the image shows we used the generated field that counts the number of records in the CSV file and added that to our text box to portray the amount of trips that were recorded in the month of August. We continued by showing the breakdown of individuals by gender of who uses these bikes most often.

  As the results show there was a count of 1,530,272 for males, 588,432 for females and 225,521 for unknown. These results give us an idea of which genders decide to use these bikes more often. 
  
  The analysis began to dig deeper by trying to solve the following questions: How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders? How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders? Lastly, a breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
